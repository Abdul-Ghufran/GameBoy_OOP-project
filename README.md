# GameBoy_OOP-project
A GameBoy made by me as a project by my institute. It uses sfml as a library in the c++ for providing the graphics for the game and then the sfml commands are used for the functioning of those graphics.

The Core Challenge
Imagine a GameBoy that boots up to life, welcomes its player, and offers three distinct gaming
experiences. Each game creates its own universe, remembers its players, and maintains their
progress. But here's the catch - you need to build it all using the principles of OOP, creating a
system so well-designed that even Nintendo's engineers would be proud.
The Building Blocks
1. The GameBoy Heart
Think of your GameBoy as a living, breathing machine that needs:
● A vibrant screen to display your digital worlds
● A welcoming menu system to guide players
● Quick-responding input controls
● A soul-stirring sound system (if you're feeling ambitious)
● The ability to rest and wake (on/off states)
2. The Player's Identity
Your GameBoy needs to know its players:
● Create unique profiles for each gaming session
● Track their epic journeys through each game (scores)
● Remember their highest achievements
● Celebrate their victories with an achievement system (optional)
3. The Game Spirit
Before the individual games come to life, you need their common ancestor:
● A base Game class that sets the rules
● The gaming DNA that all games will inherit
● A framework that makes each game unique yet familiar

4. The Gaming Trilogy

Snake: The Game of Reflexes
Build a snake that:
● Slithers smoothly across the screen
● Grows with each meal
● Faces increasingly difficult challenges
● Keeps players coming back for higher scores
● Is controlled by arrow keys or WASD keys

Wordle: The Battle of Wits

Create a word puzzle that:
● Challenges players with clever word selection
● Provides satisfying feedback
● Displays a virtual keyboard

● Limits daily attempts for authenticity (3 attempts every 15 minutes for this project)

Hangman: The Classic Revival

Design a word-guessing game that:
● Keeps players on their toes with varied words
● Shows the hanging man's progress
● Manages player lives
● Maybe even offers different word categories (optional)
● Offers a hint
